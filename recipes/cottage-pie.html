    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cottage pie is a classic comfort food dish consisting of seasoned ground meat, traditionally beef, cooked with
        onions, carrots, and sometimes other vegetables, topped with a layer of creamy mashed potatoes, and baked until
        golden and bubbling. The dish is hearty, flavorful, and satisfying, with the rich meat filling complemented by
        the creamy and buttery mashed potatoes. Cottage pie is a beloved staple in British cuisine, perfect for warming
        up on chilly days and providing a comforting meal for the whole family.</p>
