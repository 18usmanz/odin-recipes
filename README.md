# odin-recipes

THis is the first HTML project of the Odin Project Foundation Course Where I create a main page with an index.

The project is called odin-recipes where I will be creating a recipe webiste.

The index,main page, includes three links, each called a dish name, which will take you to the mentioned dishes recipe page in a seperate page in a new tab.

The seperate recipe page they open will include a picture for visual representation of the dish then it will be followed by a description which will give more detial on what this dish is. Then we will have a ingredients list and followed finally by the steps, in correct order, to make the dish.
