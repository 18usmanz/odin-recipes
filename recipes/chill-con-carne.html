    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chili con carne is a hearty and flavorful dish originating from Mexico, typically made with minced or ground
        beef, tomatoes, beans, onions, garlic, and a variety of spices such as chili powder, cumin, and paprika. Known
        for its bold and spicy flavor, it offers a satisfying balance of heat from the spices, sweetness from the
        tomatoes, and richness from the beans. Often served with rice or topped with cheese, sour cream, and cilantro,
        chili con carne is a versatile and comforting meal enjoyed worldwide, especially during colder seasons.
